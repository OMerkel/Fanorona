The rectangular Fanorona board has fixed dimension of 9 column times 5 row positions.
Positions on board are connected by a fixed line pattern showing potential
paths of movement for players’ checkers. The checkers are placed on the positions (or
points) of line intersections in the line pattern. There are two opposing players:
one is controlling the light checkers and the other is controlling
the dark checkers.

## Objective

Winning condition is to leave the opponent with no remaining legal moves left according to the rules.
Game might end in a draw on mutual agreement of both players.

Each player initially controls the 22 checkers of own color.

## Turn Sequence, Moving and Capturing

The player controlling the light checkers moves first.
Game play alternates between both players.
Passing a turn is not allowed.

Capturing is mandatory if possible. In case multiple captures exist
the active player can freely choose which to perform. On each
capture all captured opponent's checkers are removed immediately.
